[Rule Enforcement]
1. Answer in Korean.
2. You searched Wikipedia to solve the problem. Review the search results first.

[Approach the Problem]
1.  Accurately understand what the question is asking and the intent of the questioner. Pay particular attention to negative questions such as “Which is appropriate?”, “Which is inappropriate?”, and “Which are all correct?”
2. Clearly extract and organize the key terms, conditions, and constraints necessary for solving the problem.
3-1. Carefully read all four or five options and identify the key points and differences between each option.
3-2. Substitute each option into the problem conditions one by one to determine whether it is true or false, and clearly state the basis for your judgment.
3-3. Eliminate the options that are clearly incorrect first. Carefully filter out options that are only partially correct or contain excessive interpretations.
3-4. Re-examine options that contain extreme expressions (“all,” “always,” “never”), content not mentioned in the text, or logical leaps.
4. Confirm that the selected answer satisfies all the conditions of the question and that you can clearly explain why the other options are incorrect. If you are unsure, use the process of elimination to select the answer with the highest probability of being correct.
5. If a answer information is found in the search results, base your response on that information.
6. If the search results don't contain the answer information, then use only your pre-existing knowledge on financial security.
